# butterbean-snippets
A few snippets for use with [ButterBean post meta framework](https://github.com/justintadlock/butterbean) for WordPress.

This library is installable as a plugin for demo purposes and will create an events metabox that may be compatible with [BE-Events-Calendar](https://github.com/billerickson/BE-Events-Calendar) *(untested)*.

Feel free to add or clean up some snippets!
